# File format:
#   OBJECT-FILE-MATCH,OVERLAY-SYMBOL
#
# Note:
#   1. Recall that all object files generated by Yaul replace path delimeters
#      with '@'. For example, in the first line, overlay1 contains all the
#      object files in the overlay1/ directory.
#
#   2. The file generated is overlays.x, and it's located in the build
#      directory.
#
# Caveats:
#   1. There is no error reporting regarding the OBJECT-FILE-MATH token.
#   2. The OVERLAY-SYMBOL token must be unique, and must be a valid C symbol.
